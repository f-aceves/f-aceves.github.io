								<p>I'm interested to see which features have the highest

                                    the highest correlation to how much revenue a movie

										<h2>The Data:</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The Movie data can be found in
										<a href =https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies> this Kaggle Dataset
										</a>
										and came with the following features:
										<ol>
											<li>name; object</li>
											<li>rating; object</li>
											<li>genre; object</li>
											<li>year; int64</li>
											<li>released; object</li>
											<li>score; float64</li>
											<li>votes; float64</li>
											<li>director; object</li>
											<li>writer; object</li>
											<li>star; object</li>
											<li>country; object</li>
											<li>budget; float64</li>
											<li>gross; float64</li>
											<li>company; object</li>
											<li>runtime; float64</li>	
										</ol>
										Given this, I suspect that the features most correlated to gross (the revenue made by the film)
										will be budget, score, and votes. I suspect the former because a movie with a large budget
										means more money alocated to advertising. A high score implies it was well recieved and will 
										intice more people to see it. Lastly, votes is the number of people that left a score, so more votes
										imples that many more people have seen the film.

												Most features had hardly any missing values. In fact, I still had 96%
												of the origional dataset even after dropping rows with missing values.
												<p>
													Unfortunately, the one feature that I was very interested in--the budget of the film--
													had about 27% missing values. 
													I decided to approach the problem in three different ways and compare the results:
													<ol>
														<li>Leave missing values as Null</li>
														<li>Replace missing values with 0</li>
														<li>Impute missing values with the average</li>
													</ol>

									<p>If we take leaving the Null values as our control, replacing them with
										zero had and intersting result. Higher correlated featuers were strengthed
										while lower correlated features were reduced when compared to budget.
										The rest of the heatmap is identical which is expected. Imputing the mean 
										served to only reduce highly correlated features.

											<h3>All Features</h3>

										<p>Out of curiosity, I converted all object features to numeric and placed them all into 
											a heatmap. However, none of the categorical data is highly correlated to budget.

											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I was correct that votes and budget had a high correlation to
											the gross of a film. However, score turned out to have very low
											correlation to gross. This suggests a film doesn't have to be
											well recieved to earn a large profit or vice versa. One film that
											comes to mind as an example of the former case is The Emoji Movie:
										</p>
										<p>Score: 3.3; 
											Gross: $217 million
